1.)
	Write a recursive procedure named factorial which computes this function. The first
	parameter to factorial should be n, and the second parameter should be the result.
	For example, the following queries should succeed:
	?- factorial(0, 1).
	?- factorial(3, 6). 
ANSWER:
	factorial(0, 1).
	factorial(N, Result) :-
		N > 0,
		Temp is N - 1,
		factorial(Temp, Next),
		Result is N * Next.
