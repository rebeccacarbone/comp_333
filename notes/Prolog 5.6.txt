-------------Recursion-------------

Prolog does not have mutable state so loops will either loop for ever or never execute 
	- the condition will never change

Because of this, recurison is required for any interation

Function vs relation
	- Function: given these inputs you always have these outputs
	- Relation: does not have the same 1-to-1 relationship
	
No built-in mutual exclusion
	Ex: fib(0, X). will try to go to fib(0,0) AND fib(N, Result)
		because of this, include N > 1 in fib(N, Result)
		
		
-------------Structure-------------

Like a tuple
	Ex:
		X = foobar(3, apple, 14). 
		is a structure
