Consider the following code snippet which accesses an array out-of-bounds:

myArray[123456]
1.) (3 pts) Assume we're working in a strongly-typed language. What might happen as a result of this out-of-bounds array access?

2.) (3 pts) Assume we're working in a weakly-typed language. What might happen as a result of this out-of-bounds array access?

3.) (2 pts) Does it matter if the language is statically-typed or dynamically-typed? Why or why not?

1.) The program would compile, but at run-time it will throw an exception related to accessing an array index out of bounds.
2. ) The program will compile and will not crash at run-time. The program will not execute correctly and depending on the language the behavior of the program may become unpredictable. 
3.) No. Java and C are both statically typed, but Java is strongly typed while C is weakly typed. The fact that they are static does not affect how they handle 
an array index out of bounds. C and PHP are both weakly typed but PHP is dynamically typed. Both languages will compile and run with an array index out of bounds.
