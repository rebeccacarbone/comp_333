Consider the following code snippet, which calls a method on an object:

x.methodNotThere()
The object referred to by x does not have the methodNotThere method defined on it. As such, this code won't work correctly.

1.) (3 pts) Assume we're working in a strongly-typed, statically-typed language. What would likely happen as a result of this mistake?

2.) (3 pts) Assume we're working in a strongly-typed, dynamically-typed language. What would likely happen as a result of this mistake?

1.) The code will not compile. Because the language is statically typed, it will check the type at compile-time and will check that the method exists. It will find that the method
does not exist and so will not compile. 
2.) The code will compile but will not successfully run. The type will be checked at runtime and because the method does not exist, the program will throw an error and will crash.
